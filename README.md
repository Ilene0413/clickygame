# clickygame
This app is a memory game.  
The app renders 12 different images.  Each image should only be clicked once. If it is clicked more than once, the user losers.
Each image listens for a click event.
The app keeps track of the user's score and the top score. If the user clicks on an image more than once, they lose and a message
appears indicating that they lost and should try again. 
If a user clicks on all 12 images only once, they get a message congratulating them that they won.
The top score shows the user the most different clicks they have gotten. 
After each click, the board shuffles the images in a random order.
The score is reset when a user loses, and the game restarts.
The game also restarts if a user wins.
Technology used Reactjs and Bootstrap.
Images are taken from various websites.
