**Clicky Game**
Clickygame is similar to a memory game. The app renders 12 different images to the screen. In order to win the game, each image
should only be clicked one time. Each image listens for click events.

The app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is
reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once and a message is displayed that they lose. If a user clicks each image only once
a message will be displayed "Congratulations - you win".

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

The game restarts after a user wins or loses.
Technology - reactjs, bootstrap
